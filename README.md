# IonPermeation

IonPermeation is a Python tool written for MDAnalysis that analyzes the ion permeation through ion channels.

It has the following functionalities:

* Computes the cumulative number of permeation events for a trajectory. 
* Calculates and plots the z-position of the ions and the water molecules that pass through the ion channel as a function of time.
* Calculates the average binding time of each passing ion to the channel constriction points.
